# Currency Converter for Alfred App

Currency Converter is a workflow for Alfred App on Mac. This is based on the Google currency conversion syntax, such as `30 USD in GBP`.

The basic way to use the converter is to call Alfred with:

> c 30 USD in EUR

Note that `in` and `to` are interchangable. The default currency is GBP (can be changed) so the following will convert from USD to GBP:

> c 30USD

> c $30  

Another shorthand is:

> c 30$ to €

And even shorter:

> c 30$ €
